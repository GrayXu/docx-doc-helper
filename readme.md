Have u ever been driven mad by complicated designs of \*.docx? Do u think VBA is not designed for human? 

Hey, star this repo, which provides lot high-level utils based on [*python-docx*](https://github.com/python-openxml/python-docx) to handle[f åk] docx files. And it's freaking faster than VBA!

table_cell_replace.py | table text replacement
replace_by_csv.py | replace text in paragraphs by a given .csv file
sign_for_known.py | sign all items in the table for known patterns

check details in header comments of \*.py files.
